### Option 1: Problem-Solution Story

```
I just spent 2 days building something warehouses desperately need.

THE PROBLEM:
A mid-size warehouse processing 1,000 orders/day with a 30% delay 
in dispatch is losing $23,000/week.

But they don't know it.

They see "things are slower" but can't quantify:
‚ùå Which process is the bottleneck
‚ùå What it's costing them
‚ùå Which solution has the best ROI

THE SOLUTION:
I built an AI Bottleneck Detector that:

‚úÖ Monitors 6 warehouse operations in real-time
‚úÖ Calculates exact financial impact ($X/day, week, month)
‚úÖ Generates specific recommendations with ROI projections
‚úÖ Identifies root causes (staffing, equipment, process design)
‚úÖ Tests "what-if" scenarios before spending a dollar

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
"Dispatch bottleneck detected ‚Üí Costing $2,400/day ‚Üí 
Add 2 loading staff (+$600/day) ‚Üí Save $1,800/day ‚Üí 
ROI: 300% ‚Üí Payback: 10 days"

This is the difference between guessing and knowing.

Built with: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Recharts
Tech stack: React 18, AI risk algorithms, real-time analytics

WHO NEEDS THIS?
Warehouses, fulfillment centers, distribution hubs processing 
200-2,000 orders/day. Anyone who can't afford enterprise 
software but can't afford NOT to optimize.

### Option 2: Feature Showcase

```
7 Features. 1 Dashboard. Zero Guesswork.

Just completed an AI-powered bottleneck detector for warehouse 
operations. Here's what it does:

1Ô∏è‚É£ REAL-TIME MONITORING
Tracks 6 warehouse processes continuously. 
Red bars = bottlenecks. No manual analysis needed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ COST IMPACT ANALYSIS
"Dispatch delay = $12K/day = $360K/month"
Exact financial impact, not vague estimates.

3Ô∏è‚É£ SMART RECOMMENDATIONS
"Add temporary dock staff ‚Üí Save $1,200/day ‚Üí ROI: $36K/month"
Specific actions with projected savings.

4Ô∏è‚É£ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
AI identifies 5 factors: Staffing (85% likely), Process Design (72%)
Know exactly what's causing the problem.

5Ô∏è‚É£ SCENARIO PLANNER
Test improvements before investing.
"Hire 2 staff + optimize process = -33% delays, +1,285% ROI"

6Ô∏è‚É£ PERIOD COMPARISON
Compare today vs yesterday vs last week.
Spot trends: üìâ Improving or üìà Degrading

7Ô∏è‚É£ RESIZABLE PANELS
Drag to customize your view. Because everyone works differently.

BUILT FOR: Mid-size warehouses (50-500 employees) that need 
enterprise insights without enterprise budgets.

TECH STACK: Next.js 14, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Recharts, 
AI algorithms

THE RESULT: Turn process data into profit decisions.

### Option 3: Before/After Transformation

```
BEFORE: "Our dispatch is slower than usual"
AFTER: "Dispatch delays cost us $360K/month. Add 2 staff = $36K/month savings. ROI: 10 days."

That's the power of the right dashboard.

I just built an AI Bottleneck Detector that transforms vague 
observations into actionable intelligence.

WHAT IT DOES:
‚Üí Monitors warehouse operations in real-time
‚Üí Calculates exact financial impact of bottlenecks
‚Üí Generates specific recommendations with ROI
‚Üí Tests scenarios before you spend
‚Üí Identifies root causes automatically

EXAMPLE SCENARIO:
Process: Dispatch
Status: 75% slower than average
Financial Impact: $2,400/day lost
Root Cause: Staffing (85% probability)
Recommendation: Add 2 loading staff
Investment: $600/day
Savings: $1,800/day
ROI: 300%
Payback: 10 days

FROM GUESSING ‚Üí TO KNOWING

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and custom AI algorithms.

TARGET USERS: Mid-size warehouses and distribution centers 
that need data-driven decisions without enterprise software costs.
