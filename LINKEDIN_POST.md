# 📱 LinkedIn Post - Personal Story Hook

---

## The Post:

**3 months ago, I watched a warehouse supervisor manually track delays on a whiteboard.**

Every hour, he'd walk the floor, note bottlenecks, calculate costs on a calculator, and scramble to fix problems AFTER they'd already cost thousands in lost productivity.

I thought: "There has to be a better way."

So I built one. 🚀

**Introducing my AI-Powered Warehouse Bottleneck Detector:**

✅ Identifies process delays in real-time across 6 warehouse operations  
✅ Calculates financial impact ($/hour) for each bottleneck  
✅ Generates AI recommendations with ROI projections  
✅ Tests "what-if" scenarios before implementing changes  
✅ Tracks improvements with period-over-period comparison  

**The Result?**
A dashboard that turns reactive firefighting into proactive optimization.

**Tech Stack:**
→ Next.js 14 (App Router)  
→ TypeScript  
→ TailwindCSS  
→ Recharts  
→ Custom AI algorithms  

**Key Features I'm Proud Of:**
• Resizable panels for personalized layouts  
• Minute-by-minute performance visualization  
• Smart filtering by process, severity, and time range  
• Scenario planner that calculates projected savings  

This is a portfolio showcase demonstrating how modern web tech can solve real operational problems.

## Alternative Hooks (Choose Your Favorite):

### Option 2 - Vulnerability Hook:
**I failed my first technical interview because I couldn't explain how I'd optimize a warehouse.**

That hurt. But instead of giving up, I spent 3 months learning operations management, building this AI dashboard, and understanding real bottleneck detection.

Now I have a portfolio project that speaks louder than any interview answer.

### Option 3 - Before/After Hook:
**Before: Warehouse managers tracking bottlenecks with spreadsheets and guesswork.**

**After: AI-powered dashboard that detects delays, calculates costs, and recommends fixes in real-time.**

I built this transformation. Here's how 👇
