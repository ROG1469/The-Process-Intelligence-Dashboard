## 💼 LinkedIn Post Template (Short Version)

```
Just built an AI Bottleneck Detector for warehouses.

Instead of guessing:
"Our dispatch is slower than usual"

Now they know:
"Dispatch delays cost $360K/month. Add 2 staff → Save $36K/month → ROI: 10 days"

7 Features:
✅ Real-time monitoring
✅ Cost impact analysis ($X/day, week, month)
✅ Smart recommendations with ROI
✅ Root cause analysis
✅ Scenario planner
✅ Period comparison
✅ Resizable panels

Built with: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS

Target: Mid-size warehouses (50-500 employees) 
that need enterprise insights without enterprise costs.
