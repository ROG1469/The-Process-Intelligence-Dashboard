# Feature Completion Summary

## ✅ ALL TASKS COMPLETED

This document summarizes all the enhancements made to the AI Bottleneck Detector dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Improvements Made

### 1. **Clarified Cost Savings Language** ✅
**Problem:** The recommendation $ amounts were confusing - users didn't know if it was investment cost or savings.

**Solution:**
- Changed "💰 $X/day" to "✅ Save $X/day"
- Changed "ROI Estimate:" to "💵 Money You'll Save:"
- Made it crystal clear these are **SAVINGS**, not costs

**Location:** `src/components/InsightPanel.tsx` (lines 345-358)

---

### 2. **Resizable Dashboard Panels** ✅
**Problem:** AI Insights panel was cramped with limited space.

**Solution:**
- Added draggable divider between Chart and Insights panels
- Users can now drag to resize panels dynamically
- Constrained between 30-80% width for usability
- Hover effect on divider shows it's draggable
- Chart width defaults to 60%, Insights 40%

**Features:**
- Smooth dragging with visual feedback
- Blue highlight when dragging
- Maintains proportions during window resize
- Mouse cursor changes to resize indicator

**Location:** `src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` (lines 15-73, 287-312)

- **Side-by-Side Metrics:**
  - Bottleneck count
  - Average delay %
  - Risk score
  - Critical issues count

- **Trend Indicators:**
  - 📈 Worsening (red)
  - 📉 Improving (green)
  - ➡️ Stable (gray)

- **Smart Summary**
  - "✅ Performance is improving"
  - "⚠️ Performance has degraded"

Last Hour vs Last 24 Hours

Current (1h)          Comparison (24h)
Bottlenecks: 3        Bottlenecks: 5
Avg Delay: 28%        Avg Delay: 42%
Risk Score: 65        Risk Score: 78

📈 Trend Analysis:
