## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED

### Fix #1: Corrected Risk Score Calculation ✅

**Problem:** Assembly with 50% delay got risk score of only **30** (should be 90+)

**Solution:** Reweighted algorithm with proper status factor

**Results:**
| Process              | Old Score | NEW Score | Change |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Assembly (critical)  | 30 ❌     | **93** ✅  | +210%  |
| Packaging (delayed)  | 38        | **63** ✅  | +66%   |
| Material Prep        | ~20 (hidden) | **30** ✅ | NOW VISIBLE |
| Receiving            | ~16 (hidden) | **28** ✅ | NOW VISIBLE |

---

### Fix #2: Lowered Default Threshold (60 → 20) ✅

**Impact:** Material Preparation and Receiving NOW VISIBLE

---

### Fix #3: Improved Messages ✅

**Before:** "🔮 Assembly predicted to worsen by 50%" (confusing)  
**After:** "🔴 Assembly running 50% behind — CRITICAL bottleneck detected (Risk: 93/100)"

---

### Fix #4: Fixed InsightPanel Bottleneck Cards ✅

**Before:** Empty, fetchHighRiskInsights() failed  
**After:** Shows all 6 processes with recommendations
