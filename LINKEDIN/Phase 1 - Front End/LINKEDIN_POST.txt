LINKEDIN POST - PERSONAL STORY HOOK
========================================

THE POST:
---------

3 months ago, I watched a warehouse supervisor manually track delays on a whiteboard.

Every hour, he'd walk the floor, note bottlenecks, calculate costs on a calculator, and scramble to fix problems AFTER they'd already cost thousands in lost productivity.

I thought: "There has to be a better way."

So I built one. ðŸš€

Introducing my AI-Powered Warehouse Bottleneck Detector:

âœ… Identifies process delays in real-time across 6 warehouse operations
âœ… Calculates financial impact ($/hour) for each bottleneck
âœ… Generates AI recommendations with ROI projections
âœ… Tests "what-if" scenarios before implementing changes
âœ… Tracks improvements with period-over-period comparison

The Result?
A dashboard that turns reactive firefighting into proactive optimization.

Tech Stack:
â†’ Next.js 14 (App Router)
â†’ TypeScript
â†’ TailwindCSS
â†’ Recharts
â†’ Custom AI algorithms

Key Features I'm Proud Of:
â€¢ Resizable panels for personalized layouts
â€¢ Minute-by-minute performance visualization
â€¢ Smart filtering by process, severity, and time range
â€¢ Scenario planner that calculates projected savings

This is a portfolio showcase demonstrating how modern web tech can solve real operational problems.

ALTERNATIVE HOOKS (CHOOSE YOUR FAVORITE)
========================================

OPTION 2 - VULNERABILITY HOOK:
-------------------------------

I failed my first technical interview because I couldn't explain how I'd optimize a warehouse.

That hurt. But instead of giving up, I spent 3 months learning operations management, building this AI dashboard, and understanding real bottleneck detection.

Now I have a portfolio project that speaks louder than any interview answer.

OPTION 3 - BEFORE/AFTER HOOK:
------------------------------

Before: Warehouse managers tracking bottlenecks with spreadsheets and guesswork.

After: AI-powered dashboard that detects delays, calculates costs, and recommends fixes in real-time.

I built this transformation. Here's how ðŸ‘‡
