========================================
VIDEO SCRIPT - PROCESS INTELLIGENCE HUB
Duration: 60 seconds (Feature Walkthrough)
========================================

APPROACH:
- Focus on FEATURES (not filters/toggles)
- Show: Homepage → Chart → AI Insights → Recommendations → Scenario Planner → Period Comparison
- End with: Your strategic decision-making role
- Message: "AI suggests. I decide. Not replaced. Augmented."

========================================

[0:00-0:05] HOME SCREEN
---------------------------
Visual: Show landing page with "Process Intelligence Hub" title

Script:
"Hi everyone This is my creation called the Process Intelligence Hub - let me walk you through how it works."


[0:06-0:10] NAVIGATE TO DASHBOARD
---------------------------
Visual: Click "Open Dashboard" button, transition to dashboard

Script:
"From the homepage, we enter the main dashboard."


[0:11-0:18] PERFORMANCE CHART
---------------------------
Visual: Point to the chart, show minute-by-minute data with peaks and valleys

Script:
"First, the performance chart, which is the ceter attraction. This shows real-time data for all 6 warehouse processes from receiving to dispatch. Each spike indicates a delay."


[0:19-0:28] AI INSIGHTS SECTION
---------------------------
Visual: Scroll down to AI Insights panel, show the bottleneck cards

Script:
"Next, the AI Insights section. It automatically detects bottlenecks and shows the financial impact. See this? $810 per hour. For a process engineer, this means I know exactly where to focus my attention."


[0:29-0:38] RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------------------
Visual: Expand one bottleneck card to reveal recommendations with ROI

Script:
"Each bottleneck comes with AI-generated recommendations. Add 2 workers to save $1,800 daily. Or implement cross-docking to save $2,400. These are my options."


[0:39-0:46] SCENARIO PLANNER
---------------------------
Visual: Click to open Scenario Planner, adjust improvement sliders

Script:
"The Scenario Planner lets me test different improvements. What if I speed up receiving by 20%? What's the total impact?"


[0:47-0:52] PERIOD COMPARISON
---------------------------
Visual: Show Period Comparison section with trend indicators

Script:
"Period Comparison tracks what's working. Current performance versus last week. Are we improving or regressing?"


[0:53-1:00] CLOSING - YOUR STRATEGIC ROLE
---------------------------
Visual: Zoom out to show full dashboard, then slow fade

Script:
"Now, I decide which solution fits our strategy, budget, and timing. AI suggests. I decide. I test scenarios, evaluate tradeoffs, and pick what works for the business. That's being AI-enabled. Not replaced. Augmented."

FILMING TIPS
========================================

1. SCREEN RECORDING:
   - Use OBS Studio (free) or Windows Game Bar (Win+G)
   - Record at 1080p, 60fps
   - Keep cursor movements smooth and purposeful
   - Practice the walkthrough 2-3 times before recording

2. EXACT TIMING BREAKDOWN:
   - 5 sec = Home screen
   - 4 sec = Navigate to dashboard
   - 7 sec = Performance chart
   - 9 sec = AI Insights section
   - 9 sec = Recommendations
   - 7 sec = Scenario Planner
   - 5 sec = Period Comparison
   - 7 sec = Strategic decision-making message
   TOTAL = 53 seconds (7 seconds buffer for pacing)

3. PACING STRATEGY:
   - Speak at conversational pace during features (0-52s)
   - Slow down slightly for the closing message (53-60s)
   - Pause briefly between sections (0.5 seconds)
   - Your final line should be emphatic: "Not replaced. Augmented."

4. WHAT TO SHOW:
   ✅ Homepage → Dashboard button click
   ✅ Chart with visible spikes/delays
   ✅ ONE bottleneck card with $ cost
   ✅ ONE expanded recommendation showing ROI
   ✅ Scenario sliders moving
   ✅ Period comparison with clear trends
   ✅ Full dashboard view at end

5. WHAT TO SKIP:
   ❌ Filters and toggle switches
   ❌ Severity selectors
   ❌ Time range dropdowns
   ❌ Resizing panels
   ❌ Multiple bottleneck cards (just show ONE)
   ❌ Technical implementation details

6. VOICE OVER:
   - Record audio separately for better quality
   - Use script but sound natural (not reading)
   - Emphasize key numbers: "$810/hour", "$1,800/day", "20%"
   - End with confidence: "AI suggests. I decide."

7. BACKGROUND MUSIC:
   - Optional: Subtle instrumental at 15-20% volume
   - Keep it minimal - your voice is the focus
   - Fade out music at 50s to emphasize closing message

========================================
